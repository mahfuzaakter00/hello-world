# hello-world
My very first repository for practicing the GitHub Flow.
This is my first branch made off of the main branch and I'm Mahfuza Akter by the way.
I have recently graduated with an Associate of Science: Computer Science degree from Langara College. I am preparing myself for my very first Web Development job. I have been working on freecodecamp courses and projects and some of my personal projects as well.
